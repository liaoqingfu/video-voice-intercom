/* RvSipTransactionState
 * ---------------------
 * Represents the state of the transaction between the server and the client. The
 * RvSipTransactionStateChangedEv() callback reports transaction state changes
 * and state change reasons. The state change reason indicates why the transaction
 * reached the new state. The transaction associates with the states enumerated
 * below:
 *
 * RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_UNDEFINED: The state is not defined.
 * RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_IDLE:
 *                          The Idle state is the initial state of the transaction
 *                          state machine. Upon transaction creation, the transaction
 *                          assumes the Idle state. It remains in this state until
 *                          Request() is called. If the request method is INVITE, the
 *                          transaction will assume the Client-Invite-Calling state.
 *                          If the request is a general request, the transaction will
 *                          assume the Client-General-Request-Sent state. If the request
 *                          is CANCEL, the transaction will assume the
 *                          Client-Cancel-Request-Sent state.
 * RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_SERVER_GEN_REQUEST_RCVD:
 *                         Upon receipt of a request (that is not a retransmission)
 *                         by a server transaction, the transaction assumes the
 *                         Server-General-Request-Received state. In this state,
 *                           it is up to you to respond to the request using the
 *                           transaction API. You may begin with sending provisional
 *                           responses. You must end with sending a final response,
 *                           or terminating the transaction.
 * RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_SERVER_GEN_FINAL_RESPONSE_SENT:
 *                          When calling Respond(), the transaction generates and sends
 *                          a response message. The transaction will then assume the
 *                          Server-General-Final-Response-Sent state. When entering this
 *                          state, a transaction timer is set to generalLingerTimer if the
 *                          transport is an unreliable transport. When this timer expires,
 *                          the transaction is terminated and assumes the Terminated state.
 *                          If the transport is a reliable transport, the transaction is
 *                          terminated and assumes the Terminated state immediately when
 *                          it reaches this state. (Timer J as defined in RFC 543).
 * RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_CLIENT_GEN_REQUEST_SENT:
 *                            After calling Request() with a method other than INVITE,
 *                          which generates and sends a Request message, the transaction
 *                          enters the Client-General-Request-Sent state. The client
 *                          transaction remains in this state until it receives a
 *                          provisional or final response from the server. Receipt of a
 *                          provisional response will cause the transaction to assume the
 *                          Client-General-Proceeding state.
 *                          Receipt of a final response will cause the transaction to assume
 *                          the Client-General-Response-Received state. While in the
 *                          request Sent state, the transaction retransmits the request message
 *                          according to the rules defined in RFC 3261, and the values configured
 *                          for T1, T2 and generalRequestTimeoutTimer (timer F).
 *                          The retransmissions take place only if the transport is an
 *                          unreliable transport. If no response is received when
 *                          generalRequestTimeoutTimer is expired, the transaction is terminated
 *                          automatically and assumes the Terminated state (in any transport).
 *    RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_CLIENT_GEN_PROCEEDING:
 *                          Upon receipt of a provisional response by a client transaction
 *                          (not a retransmission), the transaction assumes the
 *                          Client-General-Proceeding state.
 *                          The transaction will continue to retransmit the request message
 *                          until the generalRequest Timeout Timer is expired using a consistent
 *                          interval of T2 seconds as defined in RFC 3261 (only if the transport
 *                          is unreliable). Receipt of a final response will move the transaction
 *                          to the Client-General-Final-Response-Rcvd state.
 *                          If no final response is received when the generalRequest Timeout
 *                          Timer is expired, the transaction is terminated and assumes the
 *                          Terminated state.
 *    RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_CLIENT_INVITE_CALLING:
 *                           After calling Request() with the INVITE method
 *                         which generates and sends an INVITE
 *                           request message, the transaction enters the Client Invite
 *                         Calling state. The client transaction remains
 *                           in this state until it receives a provisional or final
 *                           response from the server. Receipt of a provisional
 *                           response will cause the transaction to assume the
 *                           Client Invite Proceeding state. Receipt of a final
 *                           response will cause the transaction to assume the
 *                           Client Invite Finel Response Rcvd state.
 *                         While in this state, the transaction retransmits the
 *                         request message according to the
 *                           rules defined in RFC 2543, and the value
 *                           configured for T1. If no response is received
 *                           after 7 transmissions, the transaction will
 *                           terminate automatically and will asume the Terminated
 *                         state. In reliable mode (TCP), the transaction is
 *                         terminated after the noResponseTimer expires, unless
 *                         the state has changed.
 *    RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_CLIENT_INVITE_PROCEEDING:
 *                         Upon receipt of a provisional response by a client
 *                         invite transaction (not a retransmission), the transaction
 *                         assumes the Client Invite Proceeding state.
 *                         When entering this state, a transaction timer is set to
 *                         provisionalTimer. When this timer expires, the
 *                         transaction is terminated. This way the transaction will
 *                         not wait forever for its other party.
 *                         Receipt of a final response will move the transaction
 *                         to Client Invite Final Response Rcvd state.
 *  RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_CLIENT_INVITE_PROCEEDING_TIMEOUT:
 *                          Upon reaching timeout on the
 *                          RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_CLIENT_INVITE_PROCEEDING state the
 *                          transaction assumes the Invite Request TimeOut state, if the
 *                          enableInviteProceedingTimeoutState flag is checked.
 *                          In this state the application has to decide whether to terminate
 *                          the transaction or to CANCEL it.
 *    RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_CLIENT_INVITE_FINAL_RESPONSE_RCVD:
 *                         Upon receipt of an Invite final response, The transaction
 *                         assumes the Client Invite Final Response Rcvd state.
 *                         At this state the application can initiate the ACK
 *                         request by calling the Ack() function.
 *                         After sending the ack the transaction will move to the
 *                         Client Invite Ack Sent state.
 *    RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_CLIENT_INVITE_ACK_SENT:
 *                         After calling Ack() which generates and sends an ACK
 *                           request message, the transaction enters the Client Invite
 *                         Ack Sent state.
 *                         The transaction object retransmits the ACK request
 *                         according to the reliability mechanism defined in the
 *                         protocol.
 *                         When entering this state, a transaction timer is set
 *                         to inviteLingerTimer. When this timer expires, the
 *                         transaction is terminated. This way the transaction
 *                         will not wait forever for retransmissions from the
 *                         other party.
 *     RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_SERVER_INVITE_REQUEST_RCVD:
 *                         Upon receipt of an INVITE request (that is not a retransmission)
 *                         by a server invite transaction, the transaction assumes the
 *                            Server Invite Request Received state. In this state,
 *                           it is up to you to respond to the request using the
 *                           transaction API. You may begin with sending provisional
 *                           responses. You must end with sending a final response,
 *                           or terminating the transaction.
 *    RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_SERVER_INVITE_FINAL_RESPONSE_SENT:
 *                         When calling Respond() on an Invite transaction, the
 *                         transaction generates and
 *                         sends a response message. The transaction will then
 *                         assume the Server Invite Final Response Sent state.
 *                         The transaction object retransmits the final response
 *                         according to the reliability mechanism defined in the
 *                         protocol. After 7 transmissions  timeouts the
 *                         transaction is terminated (unless the state has changed).
 *                         If an ACK message is received, the transaction moves
 *                         to the Terminated state.
 *                         This state is used only for a proxy inplementation when
 *                         the call-leg layer is not used.
 *  RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_SERVER_INVITE_ACK_RCVD:
 *                         When the server receives an ACK message the transaction
 *                         timer is set to T4 if the transport is unreliable, or to 0
 *                         otherwise. Only after this timer is expired the transaction is
 *                         terminated.
 *    RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_TERMINATED:
 *                         This is the final state of the transaction.
 *                         When a transaction is terminated, the transaction
 *                         assumes the Terminated state. Upon reaching the
 *                         Terminated state, you can no longer reference the
 *                         transaction object.
 *    RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_SERVER_PRACK_FINAL_RESPONSE_SENT:
 *                         this state is not used anymore instead we use
 *                           RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_SERVER_GEN_FINAL_RESPONSE_SENT
 *    RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_SERVER_INVITE_REL_PROV_RESPONSE_SENT:
 *                         After calling the ResponseReliable() function in the
 *                         Server Invite Request Rcvd state the a reliable
 *                         provisional response will be sent and the transaction
 *                         will assume the Server Invite Rel Prov Response Sent state.
 *                         The transaction object retransmits the Reliable
 *                         Provisional Response as any final response to the
 *                         INVITE request. After 7 transmission timeouts, the
 *                         transaction is terminated, unless the state has changed.
 *                         Receipt of the PRACK and its automatic response
 *                         moves the transaction to the
 *                         Server Invite Prack Completed State.
 *    RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_SERVER_INVITE_PRACK_COMPLETED:
 *                         While in the Server Invite Rel Prov Resposne Sent state
 *                         the invite server transaction waits for a PRACK frocess
 *                         to be completed. The PRACK process is handled by a separate
 *                         prack server transaction. When the process is completed (PRACK
 *                         request is received and respoded) the invite server transaction
 *                         assumes the Server Invite Prack Completed state. you can
 *                         continue by sending one or more provisional response and
 *                         must finish with a final response.
 *     RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_CLIENT_INVITE_PROXY_2XX_RESPONSE_RCVD:
 *                         Upon receipt of an Invite 2xx final response by a
 *                         proxy Client Invite transaction, The transaction
 *                         assumes the Proxy Client Invite 2xx Response Rcvd state.
 *                         When entering this state, the
 *                         transaction timer is set to proxy2xxRcvdTimer.
 *                         When this timer expires, the transaction
 *                         is terminated.
 *                         This state is used only for a proxy inplementation.
 *    RVSIP_TRANSC_STATE_SERVER_INVITE_PROXY_2XX_RESPONSE_SENT:
 *                         When proxing an invte 2xx response with the RespondMsg()
 *                         function, the transaction
 *                         sends a response message. The transaction will then
 *                         assume the Proxy Server Invite Final Response Sent state.
 *                         This state is used only for a proxy inplementation when
 *                         the call-leg layer is not used.
 *                         When entering this state, the
 *                         transaction timer is set to proxy2xxSentTimer.

 *
 * pfnEvTransactionCreated  - Notifies that a new server transaction was created.
 * pfnEvStateChanged        - Notifies of a transaction state change.
 * pfnEvMsgToSend           - Notifies that a message is about to be sent.
 * pfnEvMsgReceived         - Notifies that a message was received.
 * pfnEvInternalTranscCreated - Notifies that an internal client transaction was created.
 *                          This callback is called for CANCEL and PRACK transactions
 *                          that are created automatically by the SIP Stack.
 * pfnEvTranscCancelled     - Notifies that a transaction was cancelled by an incoming
 *                          CANCEL request.
 * pfnEvSupplyParams        - Requests the application parameters for the outgoing PRACK
 *                          request. The parameters needed are the cseq step and the
 *                          request URI.
 * pfnEvDNSMsgSendFailure   - Notifies about message send failure.
 * pfnEvAuthCredentialsFound - Supplies an authorization header to the application so that
 *                          an authentication check will be performed for an incoming
 *                          request.
 * pfnEvAuthCompleted      - Notifies that the authentication procedure is completed.
 * pfnEvOpenCallLeg           - Notifies the application that a request that is suitable
 *                          for opening a dialog was received (INVITE/REFER/SUBSCRIBEwith
 *                          no To tag). The application should decide whether to open a new
 *                          dialog or handle the request above the Transaction layer.
 * pfnEvOtherURLAddressFound   - Notifies about Other URL address that was found.
 * pfnEvFinalDestResolved      - Notifies that the final destination address
 *                               of the register request was resolved.
 * pfnEvSigCompMsgNotResponded - Notifies that no response was received to the last sent
 *                               SigComp message.
